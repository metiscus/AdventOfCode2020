# AdventOfCode2020

This is the source code to my solutions to the 2020 Advent of Code event.

I undertook to learn Scheme and use it to solve all of the problems. Before this project I had never written scheme beyond the first 15 or so pages of SICP.

I don't recommend that you look at any of this, it is likely hilariously bad. If you do look at it, understand that I really don't know scheme.
